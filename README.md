This is my second project created using Html, CSS and JavaScript.

Description of the project: 

The page contains an input form where users can add or search a word in a list. There are two buttons: one to add words in the list and another one to search them. 
When the search button is pressed, a message will pop-up informing the user whether the respective word is in the list or not. The message will disappear once the user clicks on the input form.
